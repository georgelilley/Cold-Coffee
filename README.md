ðŸŽ¨ Cold Coffee â€“ Audiovisual Art Animation

ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

This is a legacy project created in 2021 as part of my university studies. The code in this repository may not reflect best practices, but I believe itâ€™s important to share as part of my development. Since then, I have focused on writing cleaner, more maintainable code, following principles outlined in Clean Code by Robert C. Martin.
ðŸŽ¶ Project Overview

This project is an audiovisual animation program built using the p5.js library. It was designed to visualize the song Cold Coffee by Galt MacDermot through dynamic 3D visual art.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

-  Uses p5.js to generate real-time visuals.
-  Features 3D movement and dynamic visuals synced to the music.
-  Inspired by title sequences from film, generative art, and creative coding pioneers like John Whitney.

ðŸš¨ Note: The original audio file is not included in this repository due to copyright restrictions.
ðŸŽ¯ Research & Methodology

This project explored creative coding as an approach to audio visualization, investigating:

-  The advantages of custom-built code over pre-made VJ software.
-  The role of data mappings in linking music to visuals dynamically.
-  How timing and spatial positioning create an engaging 3D visualization experience.

ðŸš€ Future Reflection

This project introduced me to the fundamentals of generative audiovisual art. Since then, my coding practices have evolved significantly, with a focus on:
âœ… Writing modular and maintainable code.
âœ… Improving performance and scalability.
âœ… Exploring real-time generative art and AI-assisted creativity.
