# Cold-Coffee

An audiovisual art animation program created using the p5.js library created for the song Cold Coffee by Galt MacDermot. 

I have not included the audio file in this project for obvious copyright reasons.

This was one of my first projects, created in 2021.

Disclaimer:

The code in this project is not clean, but I believe it's important to share it as part of my progression and development. Since learning more and committing to better practices, I now focus on writing clean, maintainable code, as outlined in Clean Code by Robert C. Martin.
